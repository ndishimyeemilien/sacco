## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A muted blue (#6495ED) to convey trust and financial stability. This contrasts well with a light background while avoiding the cliche of green for finance.
- Background color: A light off-white (#F0F8FF), nearly the same hue as the primary, but much lighter and less saturated for a clean, professional feel.
- Accent color: A soft lavender (#D8BFD8), which is analogous to blue but distinct enough to highlight key actions and elements. This avoids the boldness of highly saturated colors.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) to keep with the digital nature of the app.
- Use simple, consistent icons to represent financial actions and data.
- Clean and structured layout with a focus on readability and ease of navigation.
- Subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback on user actions.
